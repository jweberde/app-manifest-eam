# AppManifest - A Git Based - Enterprise Architecture Management

The goal of this project is to develop a easy to create Markdown Based Record Template for documenting components and their dependencies. Similar to Infrastrcture as Code.

The record can then be either kept next to the different applications or exported from for example Kubernets or similar into the resulting target markdown.

As part of this effort we will develop
- a microservice which will parse and build the data domain representing the documentation
- a web application, which will help to explore the existing documentation
- an extension to the web application to edit the app manifests.

## “Markdown Any Decision Records” (MADR) [ˈmæɾɚ] – decisions that matter [ˈmæɾɚ].

<https://adr.github.io/madr/>

MADR is a lean template to capture any decisions in a structured way. The template originated from capturing architectural decisions and developed to a template allowing to capture any decisions taken.

Example Template:

```markdown
---
# Configuration for the Jekyll template "Just the Docs"
parent: Decisions
nav_order: 100
title: ADR Template

# These are optional elements. Feel free to remove any of them.
# status: {proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | … | superseded by [ADR-0005](0005-example.md)}
# date: {YYYY-MM-DD when the decision was last updated}
# deciders: {list everyone involved in the decision}
# consulted: {list everyone whose opinions are sought (typically subject-matter experts); and with whom there is a two-way communication}
# informed: {list everyone who is kept up-to-date on progress; and with whom there is a one-way communication}
---
<!-- we need to disable MD025, because we use the different heading "ADR Template" in the homepage (see above) than it is foreseen in the template -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD025 -->
# {short title of solved problem and solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story.
 You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* {decision driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* {title of option 1}
* {title of option 2}
* {title of option 3}
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
* … <!-- numbers of consequences can vary -->

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Validation

{describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR is validated. E.g., by a review or an ArchUnit test}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {title of option 1}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
<!-- use "neutral" if the given argument weights neither for good nor bad -->
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### {title of other option}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
* …

## More Information

{You might want to provide additional evidence/confidence for the decision outcome here and/or
 document the team agreement on the decision and/or
 define when this decision when and how the decision should be realized and if/when it should be re-visited and/or
 how the decision is validated.
 Links to other decisions and resources might here appear as well.}
